# **What is data science:**
    
## Data Analysis vs Data Science
-both clean, maniupulate, and draw insights
-DA uses historical data whilew DS deals witht he unknown and makes statistical models

## Artificial Intelligence (makes predictions and decisions based on data and algorithms without human control)
- Machine Learning (learns data to make algorithms and start modeling to make an inference from patterns in data) 
- Deep Learning (subset of machine learning that uses neural networks and unstructured data to make predictions)

## Data Analysis
-converting raw data into information to give it value to make a decision
    

# **Data Science Tools:**

## Microsoft Excel, PowerBI, Tableau, Languages (R, Julia, and Python)
-PowerBI is made by Microsoft to be easier to make dashboards and Tableau is the free version of it
-R is a statistical programming language but python can be used more generally, but Pythion is almost exclusivly used within the AI field 

# **Data Science Domains and Roles:**

## Domains
-Interactive Notebook
    -like google colab and jupyter notebook
    -nice becuase it lets us test blobk by block
-IDE (interactive development environment)
    -like Visual Studio Code
-Anaconda's Conda

# **What is Anaconda?**

## How and why to use Anaconda
-need to use Anaconda PowerShell for Winows where Macs use the Terminal
-if using jupyter notebook through anaconda then you need to create a conda working environment and install jupyter notebook within that conda environemnt


# **Data Science Roles:**

## Business Intelligence
-reporting, analytics, dashboards, dashboards, data miniung
-data analysis for business

##Data Analyst
-inspecting, cleaning data

##Data Engineering
-builsing systems, collection of data, making data available to data scientists

##Data Science
-scientific methods, processes,a nd algorithyms to gain knowledge from large, messy data sets 

##Machine Learning Engineer
-solve business problems using machine learning models

# **Data Science Roadmap:**

# Where do I start?
-think about what you know how to use right now and build off of that
    -if you know excel then look into excel data analysis tools
    -then move on to learning python for data manipulation course in CBT Nuggets
