    "You already know about `if` statements, so let's add `else` and  `elif` to the mix. \n",
    "\n",
    "`elif` is short for **else if**. For example, `if` is the first conditional expression, and if you need more, use `elif`. When you use `if` and `elif`, the last expression is normally `else.` `else` is an expression that runs when `if` and `elif` have run or were skipped. So it makes sense that it is used as the last expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use as many `elif` expressions as you need but remember not to repeat yourself. That said, the example below is not a DRY example but clearly illustrates the use of many `elif` expressions."
